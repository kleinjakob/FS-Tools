Prerequisites:
  A working FS9 toolchain for modeling and exporting models.  Usually
  consiting of GMax, MDL Commander, MakeMDL.

  A UNIX-oid operating system (GNU/Linux, GNU/Hurd, Mac Darwin, Mac OSX)
  or atleast a UNIX-oid environment like Cygwin for Windows.

  Some common tools like GNU bash, sed, grep, cut, cat, ... usually these
  are all available if you have a UNIX-oid environment (bash-shell) already.
  Additionally you need Perl 5.x, under most GNU/Linux and Mac OSX this is
  already available for you too - in case it isn't you can install it very
  easily.  Consult your systems manuals, but under GNU/Linux open your
  package manager and search for Perl and install it.
    e.g. apt-get install perl  or  yum install perl
  Under Cygwin you have to run setup.exe again to change any packages in
  your Cygwin configuration.  On the page where it asks you for packages
  search for perl and install the base package.

  If you want the tool to compile the modified .asm files directly, you
  have to download the updated BGL-Compiler for FS9 (BGLC_9.exe) freely
  available on the internet and install the wine Windows API emulator under
  GNU/Linux.
    e.g. apt-get install wine  or  yum install wine

Installation:
  Unpack the contents of this archive into any folder you like.  Please
  check that user privileges and the executeable flag is set under UNIX-oid
  systems (should be ok if the files come from a .tar archive, but .zip
  archieves destroy these flags).  If you have downloaded the BGLC_9.exe
  unpack it and place it in the same folder as the scripts.

  Now you can run this script set from the Console/Terminal Emulator by
  cd'ing to the directory where these tools are and using it as described
  below.

Useage:
  ./fstools.sh [Option] | [Arguments]

Possible Options:
  --version   Prints a short information about the version of this script.
  --help      Prints this short text on invocation.
  --licence   Prints the Licence under which this program is released.

Optional Arguments:
  If you give arguments, you have to give all four, or none at all.
  By giving the arguments you skip the interactive qestionaire about the
  input and output folders, the mother input file and the bright materials
  table.
  
  Argument 1:   absolute input folder name ending in a trailing slash (/)
                e.g. "/path/to/input/folder/"
  Argument 2:   absolute output folder name ending in a trailing slash (/)
                e.g. "/path/to/output/folder/"
  Argument 3:   name of the mother file in the input folder
                e.g. "motherfile.asm"
  Argument 4:   name of the bright materials table file in the input folder
                e.g. "brightmaterials.csv"

  Coming together as:
    ./fstools.sh "/path/to/input/folder/" "/path/to/output/folder/"
      "motherfile.asm" "brightmaterials.csv"
